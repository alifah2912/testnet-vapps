Project

Name & Category

Project: Soundness Time Capsule

Category: Social


Description

Soundness Time Capsule is a social dApp built on the Soundness Layer that allows users to create time-locked messages, notes, or images. Capsules can only be opened once the specified unlock time is reached, either privately by the recipient or publicly for communities.

This solves the problem of trust and immutability in future message delivery, something traditional platforms cannot guarantee.

SL Integration

Smart contract on Soundness Layer to store message metadata and timestamps.

Integration with Soundness ID for verified identities.

Discord bot notifications when a capsule becomes available.


Technical

Architecture

1. User creates a capsule (message + unlock time).


2. Data stored on-chain with unlockTime.


3. Optional encrypted content stored on IPFS/Arweave.


4. Once time is reached, capsule unlocks for recipient/public.


5. Notifications through Discord bot or frontend alerts.



Stack

Frontend: React + Tailwind

Backend: Node.js (optional for indexing)

Blockchain: Soundness Layer

Storage: On-chain metadata + IPFS/Arweave


Features

1. Create time-locked messages.


2. Private or public capsules.


3. Send to Soundness ID users.


4. Notifications when unlocked.
